This file declares a plan for building the entire application, there is no way I'll have everything here but it's a start.

Primary Features:
* Initial functionality will collect data from all sites
* User input fields to take name, address, phone number. This information will not be stored
* Result list, filterable by site found (hopefully using their APIs)
** Tab/Function for web services
** Tab/Function for data brokers

Supplementary or stretch features:
* Start with links to each service with instructions on how to remove yourself
* Potentially pre-fill those pages with personal information, if a permanent link is available.
* Sub pages:
** Tab/Function for junk mail (junk mail is going to be complicated)

Risks: 
* Abuse: 
** Problem: this service will make it easy to find yourself as well as others.
** Situation: If someone really wants to know, they can easily find out on their own....
* Privacy: 
** Well the information is already out there....sooo
